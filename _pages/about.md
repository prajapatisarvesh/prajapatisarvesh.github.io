I am a second-year Masters student in the Robotics program at Northeastern University. My research interests span across robot perception, machine learning, control, and optimization. Currently, my research is focused on online cost-based collision-free motion planning for underactuated robots and deep reinforcement learning for trajectory optimization.

Throughout my academic journey, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working on projects that merge cutting-edge robotics techniques with real-world applications. My experience, from assistive robots to industrial simulations, has deeply motivated me to continue my pursuit of impactful robotics research.

I'm also passionate about exploring the intersection of human-robot interaction and robotic manipulation, where robots can work seamlessly alongside humans to improve efficiency and quality of life. Whether through assisting individuals with disabilities or enhancing industrial workflows, I believe that intelligent robots have the potential to revolutionize various sectors. My work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements in robotics and their practical applications, ensuring that cutting-edge technologies can be deployed to solve meaningful, real-world challenges.

I am incoming PhD student in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering program at Northeastern University. My research interests span across robot perception, machine learning, control, and optimization. Currently, my research focuses on developing autonomous wheelchairs that empower individuals to move independently.

I'm also passionate about exploring the intersection of human-robot interaction and robotic manipulation, where robots can work seamlessly alongside humans to improve efficiency and quality of life. Whether through assisting individuals or enhancing industrial workflows, I believe that robots have the potential to revolutionize various sectors. My work has aimed at bridging the gap between theoretical advancements in robotics and their practical applications, ensuring that cutting-edge technologies can be deployed to solve meaningful, real-world challenges.

Throughout my academic journey, I’ve had the privilege of working on projects that merge cutting-edge robotics techniques with real-world applications and has motivated me to continue my pursuit of impactful robotics research.

I am a second-year Masters student in the Robotics program at Northeastern University. My research interests span across robot perception, machine learning, control, and optimization. Currently, my research is focused on online risk-aware planners using perception for improving traversability of mobile and legged robots over different terrain.

I'm also passionate about exploring the intersection of human-robot interaction and robotic manipulation, where robots can work seamlessly alongside humans to improve efficiency and quality of life. Whether through assisting individuals with disabilities or enhancing industrial workflows, I believe that robots have the potential to revolutionize various sectors. My work has aimed at bridging the gap between theoretical advancements in robotics and their practical applications, ensuring that cutting-edge technologies can be deployed to solve meaningful, real-world challenges.

Throughout my academic journey, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working on projects that merge cutting-edge robotics techniques with real-world applications and has motivated me to continue my pursuit of impactful robotics research.
